## Contributing

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Work on your fork
    1. Make your changes and additions
        - Most of your changes should be focused on `src/` and `test/` folders and/or `README.md`. 
        - Files such as `validator.js`, `validator.min.js` and files in `lib/` folder are autogenerated when running tests (`npm test`) and need not to be changed **manually**. 
    2. Change or add tests if needed
    3. Run tests and make sure they pass
    4. Add changes to README.md if needed
4. Commit changes to your own branch
5. **Make sure** you merge the latest from "upstream" and resolve conflicts if there is any
6. Repeat step 3(3) above
7. Push your work back up to your fork
8. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
